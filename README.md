# Granar_tomato

This set of data and codes was implemented during my master's thesis (link here http://hdl.handle.net/2078.1/thesis:37917).
It is composed of :
* A data folder that contains csv tables of the database used. The Quantification folder contains anatomy measurements of tomato root cross-section pictures.
* A Params folder that contains qunatified anatomies in the form of GRANAR parameters.
* functions.R is a set of simple functions used in the other codes
* Data management and achitecture is a code that create and implement the database, and process architectural measurements.
* Anatomy1 create tables with anatomical measurements, and run GRANAR.
* Anatomy2 is the statistical analysis of the anatomical measurements. 

NB : the code is implemented so that you do not need to change directories.
